Plan:

Simple api with an index endpoint that returns styling info:

{ 
  primaryColor: FFFFFF
  secondaryColor: 000000
  logoHref: "somwhere.nl/image"
  etc
}

This gets called and loaded into the server at start up.
It is sent to each page as SSR props

these render the styling based on this.

There is an api endpoint api/reload-styles on this pwa that when called
reloads all styling as if the application is restarted.
